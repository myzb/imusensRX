# imusensRX

multiplatform library (linux, windows) that receives USB packets arriving from the [ImusensTX](https://github.com/myzb/ImusensTX) project and transforms the orientation into a OpenGL
model-view matrix. The function calls are wrapped as TCL procedures and can be called by a TCL interpreter e.g., as part of a TCL Script.
